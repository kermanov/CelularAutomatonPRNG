# CelularAutomatonPRNG
A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) based on cellular automata principles.

## Overview
This project implements a PRNG utilizing the dynamics of cellular automata to generate sequences of pseudo-random numbers. The core logic is developed in C#, with additional components in Dart and HTML, suggesting a possible web-based interface or visualization.
